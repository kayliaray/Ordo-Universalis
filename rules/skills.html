                Skills represent the proficiency of creatures in certain situations
            </p>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    General skills and specializations are both types of skills. Where a general skill covers a wide range of scenarios, specializations are specific in nature. Skill checks are some of the most common dice rolls players will make in the game. Choosing which general skills and specializations players take will significantly impact what is possible and what isn't.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    General skills are parents. Specializations are the children of general skills. Players must invest in general skills to unlock an array of their child specializations. Different general skills have different specializations. Creating unique family trees when a player creates their character is one significant role to fulfill their character concept. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the Game Master asks a player to make a general skill check, that player must have at least one point in that general skill. Otherwise, they can choose to roll one attribute die associated with that general skill. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose the skill check is a specialization check. In that case, the player can roll the parent general skill check instead if they don't have the specialization. Suppose they don't have the general skill with this exception. In that case, a player can choose to roll one attribute die associated with that specialization check. 
                </p>
            <h2>General Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    A general skill check is an event that a player must overcome using dice determined by the second sphere. The general skills represent the innate ability or practice to use two attributes to deliver an outcome of a challenge presented by the Game Master.
